"""
Please write a program which asks the user for their age.
The program should then print out a message based on whether 
the user is of age or not, using 18 as the age of maturity.

Some examples of expected behaviour:

How old are you? 12
You are not of age!

How old are you? 32
You are of age!
"""

age = int(input("How old are you? "))

if age >= 18:
    print("You are of age!")
    
elif age < 18:
